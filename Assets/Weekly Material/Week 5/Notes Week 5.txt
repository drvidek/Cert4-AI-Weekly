Start of lesson:
- Have learners create a new 3D project called "Navigation Maze"
- Install the ProBuilder package
- Go to Project Settings > Player > Active Input Handling and set it to 'Both' 

Today we're going to look more closely at NavMesh components and ways we can configure our pathfinding.

Open the Navigation window (Windows > AI > Navigation) and dock it somewhere

Make 4 simple materials - the floor, a door/gate, and two agents.

Create a Plane, scale it to 10x. 15 mins to use ProBuilder to make a SIMPLE "maze", with at least one ramp/staircase up to a higher level (feel free to show them the maze in this project)

Add a NavMesh Surface to the scene, set it up and bake it. Add a Capsule, add a Nav Agent component. Probably increase the speed to around 10.

Write the 'NavigateToMouse' script. Attatch it to the capsule. Demonstrate clicking in the scene and the agent will navigate there.

AGENT TYPES:
Open the Navigation window. Add a new Agent type (Giant). Set the Name, Radius, Height, and Step Height. Add a second NavMesh Surface to the scene, set it to the Giant type, and bake it.

Note how the mesh is different - maybe a giant can't go down some narrow corridors, or they can step up over a wall.

Create a Giant by scaling a duplicate of the human agent. In the Agent component, change the Agent Type to Giant, and reduce the speed to 4.

Click in the scene to demonstrate the two agents taking different routes to get to the same destination.
