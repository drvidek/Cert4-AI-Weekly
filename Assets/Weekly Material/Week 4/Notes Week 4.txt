Start of lesson:
- Have learners create a new 3D project called "IntroToNavMesh"

In a scene, set up the waypoints just like last week but in 3D
- Create a plane, and a capsule, and at least 3 waypoints, demonstrate it works in 3D
- Place a wall in between 2 of the waypoints and show the player just moves right through
    - Could also show the player clipping through the floor and floating over the ground without perfect waypoint placement

Why/when might you use this approach:
- Super simple and very versatile, works in all directions
- Quick prototyping
- Moving platforms or obstacles
- Games without walls/complex geometry (e.g. tower defence, shoot-em-ups)

For this, we need a solution which will tell our agent where they can and can't walk - NavMesh
- Go through the slides

Create the NavMesh surface object in scene, set 'Use Geometry' to 'Physics Colliders' and bake
- Point out how the capsule and the wall leave holes in the mesh (we will fix the capsule later)

Create the NPCNavMeshDirect object and add the Agent component

Write the 'NavigateToObject' script
- Point out how little code is required - the agent handles all movement, speed, distance, etc

Create a waypoint object and set it as the nav target. Show the agent automatically moves towards a target destination without any extra code.

Duplicate the wall, move it between the agent and the destination. Play again, show the agent moves through the wall - "why did that happen?"
- Because we have to rebake the mesh!
- Do that and show the agent moves around the wall.

Now make the 'NavigateBetweenWaypoints' script by combining our two approaches
- Remember to re-bake the mesh
- Now we have an agent who moves on a set path and avoids obstacles
- point out how the waypoints don't need perfect placement, they just need to be close to the NavMesh surface

Some limitations with both approaches:
- Does not account for a moving target (e.g. following the player)

*** IF YOU HAVE TIME (10-15 minutes) ***
Create a new scene, add Terrain (3D Object > Terrain)
- In the terrain settings, reduce the width & depth to 20 or so
- Make some gentle hills and slopes on the terrain with the brush mode, using 'Raise or Lower Terrain'
- Add a NavMesh surface object and set up as before, add a new Agent object, and use the 'NavigateBetweenWaypoints' script to demonstrate the agent moving smoothly over the complex terrain
