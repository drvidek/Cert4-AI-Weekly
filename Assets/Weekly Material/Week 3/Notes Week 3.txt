Start of lesson:
- Have learners create a new 2D project called 'Simple 2D Waypoints'

First do the 'MoveTowardsObject' script as a kind of programming refresher. Demonstrate it works in scene.

Take that foundation, and expand it into the 'MoveBetweenWaypoints' script.
- "We need to track more than one position - does anyone remember a way we can track more than one thing in a variable?"
- Ask learners what they remember about arrays.

Write the script and demonstrate it working.

Create a second set of waypoints and a second agent, and use a different speed value to demonstrate reusing the script for multiple different things.

Next week we'll put this in 3D and explore some pros and cons of this soultion.
