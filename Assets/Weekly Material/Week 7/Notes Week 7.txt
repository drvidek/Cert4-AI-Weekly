Start of lesson:
- Have learners create a new 2D project called 'A Game About Blobs'

Create a prefab, 'Blob'. Add a dynamic sprite child object. Set the Sprite Renderer to 'Draw Mode' - Sliced. Add a 'Blob' tag and apply it on both objects.

Write the 'BlobSize' script. Demonstrate it working. Add the 'OnValidate' and show it working in editor.

Write the BlobCollision script. Add it to the dynamic sprite.

Add two Blob prefabs to the scene, and make one larger than the other through the BlobSize component. 

Demostrate the BlobCollision script working by manually moving the blobs into each other. (Colour will make it easier to see which Blob is "eaten")
